# Kylin Test Log Parser

* Our tool to parse the log data generated by Kylin and parse it to the configuration map.

* Under development

* Current stage: 
    - `generate_all_tests.py` Implement function to generate all test commands into Kylin file
    - `map_logs.py` Map the result from getters and setters in test log data into json file
    - `read_properties.py` Read all properties
    - `injection.py` Inject properties

* TODO:
    - Add a function that reads in all the default property value received by get, to aid trying different value in future.
